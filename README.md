# TempleOS and ZealOS OpenSource Software
## Compiling on TempleOS

Type the name of the file (without the .HC extension) and press Enter.

For example, if your file is named Hello.HC, type:
```
Hello;
```
TempleOS will automatically compile and run the program.

## Compiling on ZealOS (Part 1)

Compile and run the program:

Type Zc to open the ZealC compiler.

In the compiler, type the name of the file (with the .ZC extension) and press Enter.

For example, if your file is named Hello.ZC, type:
```
Hello.ZC
```
The compiler will compile and run the program automatically.

## Compiling on ZealOS to binary (Optional)

If you want to compile the program into an executable file that you can run later:

Use the Build command:

Type Build followed by the filename (with the .ZC extension). For example:
```
Build Hello.ZC
```
This will create an executable file named Hello.BIN

Run the executable:

Type the name of the executable (without the .BIN extension) and press Enter. For example:
```
Hello
```
